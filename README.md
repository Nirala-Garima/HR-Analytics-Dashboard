# HR-Analytics-Dashboard using Power-Bi
 Laid my hands on an another interactive project "HR Analytics Dashboard" of a fictional company. The scope of the project was to drive insights regarding the attrition of employees based on various performance indicators and help the HR dept. to make data driven decisions based on real -time insights.
 
 #Insights:-
 1. By conducting analysis on employee feedback on job satisfaction and attrition by job field , it is revealed that highest overall rating 3 is provided by the job role of lab technician,followed by research scientist and sales executive ,further revealed that majority of employees are from life sciences field followed by medical and marketing. Therefore the highest attrition is among these fields and Job role only.
    
 2. Attrition by Salary and Age higlights that lower salary employees i.e,"Upto 5k" betwwen age group 26-35 is more tend to leave the organisation that address the fair compensation issues among the organisation.
    
3. Men are likely to leave the organisation more as compared to female employees making the overall attrition rate to be 16.1%.

 This insights triggers the implementation of various strategic initiatives by HR professionals to address these gaps and ensure various measures to retention strategy focusing on continued learning opportunities, equal pay and continued recognition and opportunities to young employees at bottom level.
